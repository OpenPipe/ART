### Train GRPO-powered RL agents for real-world tasks!

# Agent Reinforcement Trainer (ART)

ART is an open-source reinforcement training library for improving LLM performance in agentic workflows. ART utilizes the powerful GRPO reinforcement learning algorithm to train models from their own experiences. Unlike most RL libraries, ART allows you to execute agent runs **in your existing codebase** while offloading all the complexity of the RL training loop to the ART backend. Read about the [ training loop](#training-loop-overview). Then try out one of the notebooks below!

## 🔁 Training Loop Overview

ART's functionality is divided into a **client** and a **server**. The OpenAI-compatible client is responsible for interfacing between ART and your codebase. Using the client, you can pass messages and get completions from your LLM as it improves. The server runs independently on any machine with a GPU. It abstracts away the complexity of the inference and training portions of the RL loop while allowing for some custom configuration. An outline of the training loop is shown below:

1. **Inference**

   1. Your code uses the ART client to perform an agentic workflow (usually executing several rollouts in parallel to gather data faster).
   2. Completion requests are routed to the ART server, which runs the model's latest LoRA in vLLM.
   3. As the agent executes, each `system`, `user`, and `assistant` message is stored in a Trajectory.
   4. When a rollout finishes, your code assigns a `reward` to its Trajectory, indicating the performance of the LLM.

2. **Training**
   1. When each rollout has finished, Trajectories are grouped and sent to the server. Inference is blocked while training executes.
   2. The server trains your model using GRPO, initializing from the latest checkpoint (or an empty LoRA on the first iteration).
   3. The server saves the newly trained LoRA to a local directory and loads it into vLLM.
   4. Inference is unblocked and the loop resumes at step 1.

This training loop runs until a specified number of inference and training iterations have completed.

## 🛰 Remote Server Usage

ART's server can run on any machine with a GPU. Start it on the remote host:

```bash
uv run art --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7999
```

From your local machine, create a `Backend` that points at this server and
register your model with it:

```python
backend = art.Backend(base_url="http://<server-ip>:7999")
await model.register(backend)
```

`model.openai_client()` will now send completions to the remote server and all
calls to `model.train()` execute there as well. See
`examples/remote_backend/remote_2048.py` for a full example.

## 🔥 Temperature Annealing

You can linearly anneal the sampling temperature between training calls. Create
a `LinearTemperatureAnnealer` and attach it to your `TrainableModel`:

```python
annealer = art.LinearTemperatureAnnealer(start=1.0, end=0.1, steps=10)
model.set_temperature_annealer(annealer)
```

Each call to `model.train()` will advance the schedule and restart the
OpenAI-compatible server with the new default temperature. Explicit temperatures
passed to `model.openai_client().chat.completions.create()` still override the
current default.

## 🧩 Supported Models

ART should work with most vLLM/HuggingFace-transformers compatible causal language models, or at least the ones supported by [Unsloth](https://docs.unsloth.ai/get-started/all-our-models). Gemma 3 does not appear to be supported for the time being. If any other model isn't working for you, please let us know on [Discord](https://discord.gg/zbBHRUpwf4) or open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/openpipe/art/issues)!
